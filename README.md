## 🛠 Project Overview

**SLModes** is a music software for Windows dedicated to the music modes.

![](https://sinewavelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SLModes-Modal-Modulation-Pitch-Axis-Theory-Greek-Modes-v03.webp)

It takes music theory concepts like **music** **modes**, **modal modulation, pitch axis theory,** and **negative harmony,** and makes them more intuitive to use. 

You will find ideas for *uncommon chord progressions* that lie outside of your normal intuition. It makes you **think outside the box**.

## ⭐ **Basic Feature: Music Modes Exploration**

Get access to:

🎼 A list of **9 scales**: *Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor, Harmonic Major, Double Harmonic Major, Neapolitan Major, Neapolitan Minor, Hungarian Minor and Romanian Major*.

🎵 Each scale has 7 modes, giving you a total of **63 modes** to explore.

🎹 For each mode, it shows its **chords** *(this is huge!)* and their **notes.**

🎧 It provides **instant feedback** on how a mode sounds and feels like, by playing it arpeggiated over a modal chord.

🎸 For each mode, it shows its **guitar fretboard shape** and **piano notes**.

## ⭐ **Advanced Feature: Modal Modulation**

Given a mode, SLModes will create a list of **matching modes** based on how many **notes in common** they have.

Example: *From the list of 63 modes, find those that have 4 notes in common with C Locrian.*

💡 **This is a new way of thinking about chord progressions!**

This allows you to jump between modes that don’t necessarily belong to the same scale / key. However, since they have at least some notes in common, acting as a bridge, the jump can always be made to work.

## ⭐ **Advanced Feature: Negative Harmony**

With negative harmony, we can choose a mode and then use the Circle Fifths, Fourths or Seconds to generate a corresponding negative mode and negative chords (or even a negative melody!)

Either to come up with a complete negative version of a chord progression you already have, or simply to grab some *borrowed negative chords,* having a Negative Harmony tool can give you even more ideas for your music compositions.

## ⭐ **Basic Feature: Composer Mode**

**Composer Mode**, allows you to write down your chord progressions, and play them in a loop, which allows you to improvise over them if you want.

And when you're done, you can export the chord progression to a MIDI file, and import it into your DAW.

## ⭐ **Basic Feature (for Guitar Players): Extended Guitar Fretboard**

You can also open the **extended freboard mode**, to access the notes of the mode across the entire guitar fretboard. You can have custom tunings.

The green notes show the root note of the mode.

Alternatively, the extended fretboard can also show the notes of any currency selected chord in blue. This makes it easy to learn all the **chords positions, inversions** and **arpeggios** across the entire guitar fretboard.

## 🎵 Example: Same Music Idea written in Different Modes

How would the same music idea sound if it were written in the obscure modes of Mixolydian b6 and Ionian #5? In this video I will show you how two modes can affect the mood and emotional impact of the same musical idea.

## ❓ But... what *are* Modes anyway?

If you actually don't fully understand the modes, let me tell you something: there are complicated ways of explaining the modes, and there are simple ways. Some people will charge you $$$ for some course to teach you this stuff, but I will just show you for free in 5 minutes, in a way anyone can understand (even if my *practical* explanation displeases the music theory snobs).
